# üêç Python Basics ‚Äì Learning Journey

This repository contains my doundation for ML in python, it contains notes, practice labs, and mini projects as I learn Python through a beginner-friendly, hands-on course.

## ‚úÖ What I‚Äôve Learned So Far

Throughout this course, I‚Äôve gained a solid foundation in Python programming, including:

- **Python Basics**  
  Variables, data types, operators, expressions, and string manipulations.

- **Data Structures**  
  How to create and work with:
  - Lists
  - Tuples
  - Dictionaries
  - Sets

- **Control Flow & Logic**  
  Writing clean logic using if-else statements, loops, and conditional expressions.

- **Functions & Error Handling**  
  Defining and using functions effectively, plus handling exceptions using try/except blocks.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  Basics of classes, objects, attributes, and methods.

- **File I/O**  
  Reading from and writing to files in various formats (text, CSV, etc.).

- **Python Libraries**
  - `NumPy`: For numerical operations and array handling
  - `Pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis

- **Working with APIs & Web Scraping**
  - Using `requests` to interact with REST APIs
  - Scraping website data using `BeautifulSoup`

## üí° What I Can Do Now

With the skills I‚Äôve built, I‚Äôm able to:

- Build basic to intermediate Python programs  
- Automate repetitive or data-based tasks  
- Read, process, and analyze data using Pandas and NumPy  
- Interact with APIs and extract data from web pages  
- Write reusable code using functions and object-oriented practices  
- Handle real-world errors and exceptions with confidence  
- Work comfortably with files and data formats
